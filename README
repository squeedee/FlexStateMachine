Flex State Machine, A best approximation of a DSL.

This is a heavy WIP, nonetheless it works well in our production code.
To make the state machine as 'DSL' like as possible i've tried to take 
advantage of mixins to allow one class to 'act_as' a state machine. This part 
hasn't worked out so well, but it is my intention to make it happen if
at all possible.

Samples and Docs shortly.

All code is under the MIT license.
